Automated Security Incident Response System on AWS leveraging Lambda, CloudWatch, and CloudTrail for real-time incident monitoring and response automation.
# Automated Security Incident Response System on AWS

Welcome to the **Automated Security Incident Response System (ASIRS)** — your cloud’s vigilant guardian! This project demonstrates a scalable, serverless AWS solution that automates immediate actions on security events, ensuring your infrastructure stays secure without lifting a finger.

---

## Why This Project?

In today’s cloud-driven world, security incidents can happen anytime and anywhere. But reacting manually? That’s risky and slow. This project shows how to leverage AWS services to automatically detect and respond to security threats in real time. Think of it as a savvy digital security guard powered by Lambda functions, CloudWatch alarms, and CloudTrail logs—all working around the clock to protect your environment.

---

## How It Works: System Architecture

The magic happens when AWS CloudTrail and CloudWatch team up to constantly monitor your cloud environment. When suspicious activity or a predefined security event is detected, CloudWatch triggers AWS Lambda functions to take immediate, automated response actions—whether it's isolating a compromised resource, revoking permissions, or alerting your security team.

### Architecture at a Glance:

- **CloudTrail** tracks API calls and user activity across your AWS account.
- **CloudWatch** watches log metrics and sets alarms based on security event patterns.
- **Lambda** functions perform predefined reactions instantly once triggered.
- **SNS (Simple Notification Service)** sends real-time alerts to security personnel for awareness.
- **IAM Roles** enforce tight security control and least privilege access principles.

## Tech Stack

- AWS Lambda (Python/Node.js)
- AWS CloudWatch (Logs, Events, Alarms)
- AWS CloudTrail
- AWS SNS for notifications
- AWS IAM for secure permissions
- Optional: AWS CloudFormation/Terraform for infrastructure as code deployment

---

## Getting Started: Deploy Your Guardian Angel

### Prerequisites

- AWS CLI installed and configured
- AWS account with appropriate permissions
- Python 3.x installed (if using Python Lambda functions)

### Deployment Options

1. **CloudFormation Template**  
   Use the provided CloudFormation YAML file to deploy the entire stack with a single command:


2. **Manual Setup**  
- Enable CloudTrail in your AWS account  
- Create CloudWatch log groups and metrics filters  
- Deploy Lambda functions and configure triggers  
- Setup SNS topics and subscriptions for notifications  
(Check `/docs/setup-guide.md` for step-by-step instructions.)

## Using the System

Once deployed, the system automatically begins monitoring your AWS environment. You can test incident responses by simulating security events (e.g., unauthorized API calls). Watch as Lambda executes remediation steps instantly and notifications fly out to your security team.

---

## Peek Under the Hood: Code Overview

Each Lambda function corresponds to a specific security incident type, for example:

- `unauthorized-access-handler`: Reacts to unauthorized access attempts and revokes suspicious session tokens.
- `network-anomaly-handler`: Detects unusual network behavior and isolates affected resources.
- `log-cleanup-handler`: Manages log retention policies to maintain optimal performance and storage.

Code is modular, well-commented, and designed for easy customization!

## Security Considerations

This system follows **least privilege** principles—every component only has the minimum permissions it needs to operate. Sensitive data is never exposed, and logging ensures full forensic visibility. Adjust IAM roles and policies to fit your organization’s security standards.

---

## What’s Next?

- Add AI-driven anomaly detection to anticipate threats before they hit
- Integrate with third-party SIEM tools for centralized monitoring
- Create dashboards for visualizing ongoing security posture
- Extend automation to multi-cloud environments
