Automated Security Incident Response System on AWS leveraging Lambda, CloudWatch, and CloudTrail for real-time incident monitoring and response automation.
# Automated Security Incident Response System on AWS

Welcome to the **Automated Security Incident Response System (ASIRS)** — your cloud’s vigilant guardian! This project demonstrates a scalable, serverless AWS solution that automates immediate actions on security events, ensuring your infrastructure stays secure without lifting a finger.

## Why This Project?

In today’s cloud-driven world, security incidents can happen anytime and anywhere. But reacting manually? That’s risky and slow. This project shows how to leverage AWS services to automatically detect and respond to security threats in real time. Think of it as a savvy digital security guard powered by Lambda functions, CloudWatch alarms, and CloudTrail logs—all working around the clock to protect your environment.

## How It Works: System Architecture

The magic happens when AWS CloudTrail and CloudWatch team up to constantly monitor your cloud environment. When suspicious activity or a predefined security event is detected, CloudWatch triggers AWS Lambda functions to take immediate, automated response actions—whether it's isolating a compromised resource, revoking permissions, or alerting your security team.

### Architecture at a Glance:

- **CloudTrail** tracks API calls and user activity across your AWS account.
- **CloudWatch** watches log metrics and sets alarms based on security event patterns.
- **Lambda** functions perform predefined reactions instantly once triggered.
- **SNS (Simple Notification Service)** sends real-time alerts to security personnel for awareness.
- **IAM Roles** enforce tight security control and least privilege access principles.
